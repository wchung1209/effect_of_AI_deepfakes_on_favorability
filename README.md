# Measuring the Causal Effect of AI Deepfake Videos on Favorabilities of Public Figures
This is a project repo for DATASCI241: Experiments and Causal Inference project.

## 

# Abstract 

This project designs and executes a causal experiment in which the effect of deepfake videos created by AI is measured as difference in favorability of the figures deepfaked between treatment and control groups. Using statistical analyses, we delve into the causal inference and the implications of AI in the Internet.
